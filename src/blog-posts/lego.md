Hi everyone! My partners and I took a daytrip out to Seattle to meet up a friend over the weekend, and we went to a few stores while we were in the area - one of which was the LEGO store! I've never been in one before, so I was super excited and looking at LEGO sets since I knew I wanted to at least get one.

Well, anyone who knows anything about me knows I love all things space, and apparently they had the Discover Space Shuttle in stock, so... one thing led to another and I got it! One of my partners bought it for me as a gift, and I'm super, super grateful because this set is expensive.

I spent the weekend building it, staying up far later than I probably should have, but I got it done! It looks really cool, and has so many functional parts to it. The landing gear extends and retracts in a spring-loaded mechanism, the elevons are linked together so you can roll the shuttle (if it could fly anyways), it includes the cockpit and middeck, and it has the airbrake in the tailfin that the real Discovery had! LEGO really did not need to go this hard, but they did and it makes the model all the more worth it!

It's honestly been years since I've gotten to build with LEGOs, and it makes me almost want to start a YouTube channel where I just build stuff with LEGOs, just for the fun of it. My fingers will hate me, but it could be a lot of fun to do!

As for the actual trip to Seattle, it was a very pretty drive. 4 hours across the entire state, driving through the Cascades, over rivers and valleys. It was just stunning and breath-taking, and a little terrifying! It was the first time I've driven on such mountainous terrain, so it was a little nerve-wracking, but it was awesome!

We're already planning to make that trip again sometime later this year or next year, as well as going out to some of the camping spots we saw on the drive there. It would be great to just head out that way for the sight-seeing alone, and I'll make sure to get some really good pictures next time!

Anyways, I hope the next blog post I make will actually be on game design, I haven't had a chance to sit down and write one. I want to say it'll be on UI design, but I may do it on something else entirely. We'll just have to wait and see!
