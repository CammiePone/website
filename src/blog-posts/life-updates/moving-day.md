Hey again! I've finally moved into my own place over on the west coast, after 7 months of not having a home. It's really nice, I really like it here. I'm now living with two of my partners, even if we don't have a bed quite yet. That comes Tuesday!

We've kinda been sleeping on the floor, and we'll manage for two more nights. The trip was mostly smooth, though at the very last moment - literally hours before we were about to leave to get the keys - we... kinda had a break-in to the car. One of my partners' desktop computer was stolen, and my other partner's suitcase was stolen - which had their computer among several other things in it.

Hopefully we can replace them soon, but it's gonna be very rough. If, uh. Anyone is willing to give any help with that, we would greatly appreciate it. If you wanna send donations to my _**[PayPal](https://paypal.me/camcodes?country.x=US&locale.x=en_US)**_ it would be greatly appreciated.

I might also share my thoughts on some of the local food places around here, because they've got some really nice food in this city, so I guess watch for that come this Wednesday!

I'm wishing a good day for everyone reading though! Unless you were the thieves. I hope you get caught.
