Welcome! My name is Cammie Pet, I'm an indie game designer and developer! I'm hoping to post at least once every other week here, but it may be a bit rough getting into that habit at first.

This blog is going to be a place where I discuss game design principles, updates on current projects, and general interests I want to share with the world!

Some of those projects - at the time of writing - are Arcanus: Continuum, Starfinder, and End Fable. The first two are mods for Mojang's *Minecraft: Java Edition*, while the latter is my foray into commercial game development!

I may setup an email list at a later date, but for now setting up this much of the site has taken a bit of time, so I'm going take a well-deserved nap.

I hope you enjoy reading through future posts, and I look forward to making the first *REAL* post soon!
