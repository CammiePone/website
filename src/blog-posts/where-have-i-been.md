Hey, it's been a little over a month since the last blog post. I've been rather busy this past month and a half, and haven't had an opportunity to just sit down and write another blog post. Some of you may know this, but I lived in Florida most of my life, and being as it's currently going downhill at a rapid pace... well, now I'm kind of displaced. Some friends offered to put us up in their place for a while, which is kind of where I've been. I've got a job as a delivery driver for now, which has been helping a lot, but it's left me with very little energy when I get home.

It's been stressful, moving all the way from Florida to Illinois, and that stress isn't over yet since my fiance and I are now moving from Illinois to Washington state. We've found a place, haven't signed the lease yet but we should be able to soon, and once we're there, it'll be a bit hectic since we're going to have to re-buy all of the furniture we had to leave behind in Florida, but we'll manage I hope.

On top of that, due to extraneous circumstances involving some of my modder friends, I've decided to pull the plug on any and all modding work I do going forward. The community has just proven... frustrating to the point it's just not worth the extra stress. Especially since monetarily, it's not all that lucrative and doesn't even get close to paying for food, much less the bills. So that chapter of my life is closed, and we're on to a new one.

But it's not all doom and gloom! I've spent what energy I have had working on the design docs for End Fable, and I hope to post some information about it here as I get more stuff solidified. I've actually gotten 1/3 of all the characters done at this point, and I'm working on learning Blender so I have more than just 2D concept art to show off.

Obviously there's still a lot of work to go, and I still want to make some blog posts about general game design as a resource for people wanting to get into game design, either as a hobby or professionally. But we're driven and have the skills needed to develop the game we've got, it's just a matter of time!

I also plan to partake in a few game jams this year, so with any luck those go well! I missed GMTK, but that one may have been a little too much stress for what would effectively be the first game jam I'd ever participated in.

As for this website, I'm probably going to remove the commission section. I'll probably replace it with a general contact form, that way if someone still wants to commission me, they still have a line of communication to me.

So I hope this fills in anyone who was wondering why I hadn't made any other blog posts in a while, and hopefully I'll start making more of these soon and with more frequency!
